# FlowMaster Plumbing — Static Website

## Project Description

FlowMaster Plumbing is a static, responsive website built as a Portfolio of Evidence for a supplementary web development exam. The site presents company information, a searchable services list, enquiry and contact forms, and an interactive map showing FlowMaster's headquarters. It is coded using semantic HTML5, CSS3 (Grid & Flexbox) and Vanilla JavaScript, and uses Leaflet.js for the map integration.

## Development Phase Log

- **Phase 1 — Structure:** Established semantic HTML5 architecture and folder hierarchy. Created five pages: `index.html`, `about.html`, `services.html`, `enquiry.html`, `contact.html`. Ensured accessibility basics and SEO meta tags were included.

- **Phase 2 — Styling:** Implemented a responsive layout using CSS Grid for content sections and Flexbox for navigation. Applied a professional blue (#0056b3) and white color palette and added responsive media queries. Created a mobile-first hamburger menu.

- **Phase 3 — Functionality:** Integrated JavaScript for interactivity: hamburger menu toggle, client-side form validation for `enquiryForm` and `contactForm`, search filtering on `services.html`, and a fully interactive Leaflet.js map with a custom marker and popup on `contact.html`.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Serve the folder (optional) or open `index.html` directly in a browser. For full map functionality ensure internet connectivity for Leaflet and tile layers.
